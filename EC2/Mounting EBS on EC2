After cleating a volume and attaching in ec2 instance in GUI.
in Putty
sudo su -> root user
df -h -> Disk Free, Human Readable (new volume will not be there, but will show all other disks)
lsblk -> list information about block devices (in this we can see all the devices)
--> NOW format and mount the block <--
 mkfs.exet4 /dev/xvdb -> format the block (xvdb is block name)
before mounting we need to create a mount point in root directory create a folder then mount there
mkdir /test -> make direcotry name as test
mount /dev/xvdb /test -> from this to this.

to check if its mounted or not
df -h

to unmount

umount /test
